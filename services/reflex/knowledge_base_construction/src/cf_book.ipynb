He has a habit of doing that, like a fly you thought you'd chased from the room.`` Ryan alluded to the upset this remark caused him in a special Ryan Tubridy Confidential, aired on 16 October 2008 to coincide with the release of the presenter's autobiography, in which the tables were turned on the regular interviewer as he was asked questions by his protegé Ryan Tubridy. Tubridy was selected after RTÉ expressed their dissatisfaction at Ryan's original plan - to interview himself. The eighth and final series featured interviews with Conan O'Brien, Roger Moore and, Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion. The Hefner and O'Brien interviews were recorded in Los Angeles. In a rare interview O'Brien said he was more comfortable with Ireland than the pressures of American television. Ryan's interview with Heather Mills from the eighth series was first broadcast the night before his death. A re-edited and extended version of the 2008 episode, in which Ryan was interviewed by Ryan Tubridy, was aired after the presenter's death. It drew an audience share of 40.5 per cent, and 565,000 viewers - the highest ratings for any episode of Ryan Confidential. The final Ryan Confidential filmed   \n",
